app-office/grisbi:goffice - enable goffice graphic support
media-gfx/rawtherapee:lto - Enable LTO during build
media-sound/pulseaudio:X - Build the X11 publish module to export PulseAudio information through X11 protocol for clients to make use. Don't enable this flag if you want to use a system wide instance. If unsure, enable this flag.
media-sound/pulseaudio:alsa-plugin - Request installing media-plugins/alsa-plugins with PulseAudio plugin enabled. This ensures that clients supporting ALSA only will use PulseAudio.
media-sound/pulseaudio:asyncns - Use libasyncns for asynchronous name resolution.
media-sound/pulseaudio:daemon - Build the pulseaudio binary (not-needed for pipewire-pulse)
media-sound/pulseaudio:doc - Build the doxygen-described API documentation.
media-sound/pulseaudio:elogind - Use sys-auth/elogind for giving each session a PA client
media-sound/pulseaudio:equalizer - Enable the equalizer module (requires sci-libs/fftw).
media-sound/pulseaudio:forget-missing - Enables clearing of unavailable devices from database files which is recommended for GNOME.
media-sound/pulseaudio:gdbm - Use sys-libs/gdbm to store PulseAudio databases. Recommended for desktop usage. This flag causes the whole package to be licensed under GPL-2 or later.
media-sound/pulseaudio:glib - Add support to dev-libs/glib-based mainloop for the libpulse client library, to allow using libpulse on glib-based programs. Build the GSettings PA module.
media-sound/pulseaudio:native-headset - Build with native HSP backend for bluez 5.
media-sound/pulseaudio:ofono-headset - Build with oFono HFP backend for bluez 5, requires net-misc/ofono.
media-sound/pulseaudio:oss - Enable OSS sink/source (output/input). Deprecated, upstream does not support this on systems where other sink/source systems are available (i.e.: Linux). The padsp wrapper is now always build if the system supports OSS at all.
media-sound/pulseaudio:ssl - Use dev-libs/openssl to provide support for RAOP (AirPort) streaming.
media-sound/pulseaudio:system-wide - Allow preparation and installation of the system-wide init script for PulseAudio. Since this support is only supported for embedded situations, do not enable without reading the upstream instructions at https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/WhatIsWrongWithSystemWide/ .
media-sound/pulseaudio:systemd - Build with sys-apps/systemd support to replace standalone ConsoleKit.
media-sound/pulseaudio:webrtc-aec - Uses the webrtc.org AudioProcessing library for enhancing VoIP calls greatly in applications that support it by performing acoustic echo cancellation, analog gain control, noise suppression and other processing.
